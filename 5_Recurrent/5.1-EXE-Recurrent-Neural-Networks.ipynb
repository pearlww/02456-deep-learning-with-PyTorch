In the context of natural language processing a token could be a character or a word, but mind you that the concepts introduced here apply to all kinds of sequential data, such as e.g. protein sequences, weather measurements, audio signals, or videos, just to name a few.\n","\n","To really get a grasp of what is going on inside a recurrent neural network (RNN), we will carry out a substantial part of this exercise in NumPy rather than PyTorch. We start off with a simple toy problem, build an RNN using NumPy, train and it, and see for ourselves that it really works. Once we're convinced, we proceed to build and train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cell, also in NumPy. This is *not* simply to cause you frustration, but rather to provide you with a deeper understanding of the recurrence in RNNs, which will become very beneficial to you in the following weeks. Once you understand the inner workings of an RNN, we will proceed to a PyTorch implementation that you may use for the remainder of the course and in your projects.\n","\n","To summarize, in this notebook we will show you:\n","* How to represent sequences of categorical variables\n","* How to build and train an RNN in NumPy\n","* How to build and train an LSTM network in NumPy\n","* How to build and train an LSTM network in PyTorch"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"XapO8SLwiACd"},"source":["## Representing tokens or text\n","\n","In previous labs we mainly considered data $x \\in \\mathrm{R}^d$, where $d$ is the feature space dimension.\n","With time sequences our data can be represented as $x \\in \\mathrm{R}^{t \\, \\times \\, d}$, where $t$ is the sequence length. \n","This emphasises sequence dependence and that the samples along the sequence are not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).\n","We will model functions as $\\mathrm{R}^{t \\, \\times \\, d} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{R}^c$, where $c$ is the amount of classes in the output.\n","\n","There are several ways to represent sequences.

But what do we do if we're modelling data with strong dependency in both directions? Like in many things deep learning, we can build powerful models by stacking layers on top of each other; *bi-directional* RNNs consist of two LSTM cells, one for each direction. A sequence is first fed into the forward LSTM cell and the reversed sequence is then used as input to the backward LSTM cell together with the last hidden state from the forward LSTM cell. Follow [this link](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4b80/89bc9b49f84de43acc2eb8900035f7d492b2.pdf) for the original paper from 1997(!).\n","\n","For even deeper representations, multiple layers of both uni-directional and bi-directional RNNs can be stacked ontop of each other, just like feed-forward and convolutional layers. For more information on this, check out the [LSTM PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#lstm). Next week we will also explore ways to combine RNNs with other types of layers for even more expressive function approximators."]}]}
